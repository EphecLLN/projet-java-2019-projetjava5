 * This class inherits from the super class "Grid".
 * This class lets us create a grid that is representing the player's own grid 
 * in which he will place his own units and observe the shots from his opponent. 
 * 
 * Each grid cell will by default be populate with a null object.
 * When the player will be placing his units, each unit will be placed in each cell it is made of. 
 * 
 * Example: an Airport unit (wich is 2x4 cells) is placed in cells : 
 * B3 B4 B5 B6
 * C3 C4 C5 C6 
 * Each of these cells will containt the Airport unit (and therefor its properties).
